Next week (July 16-17), we will have the [kick-off workshop](https://ias.uva.nl/content/events/2024/07/logic-and-ai.html?origin=PRy12xnsQemXLkKbh0An2g) of our project on [Logic and AI](https://levinhornischer.github.io/Logic-and-AI/). On-site participation is already fully booked, but you can still participate online. Just sign up via the workshop website, it would be great to virtually see you there!
