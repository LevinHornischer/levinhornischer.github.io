[Shawn Standefer](https://shawn-standefer.github.io/) (National Taiwan University) and I have been awarded funding from the _NTU-LMU Joint Seed Funding_ for the project "Synonomy in AI". The project is about bridging Large Language Models and Formal Semantics, focusing on the concept of synonymy. Very much looking forward to it!
