In this very first post, I figured I’d say a quick word about the <em>what &amp; why</em> of this blog, before writing the first post with actual content next.</p>

<p>This blog, like many things, got started after having had a loose plan for a while, until some event provided the momentum to realize the plan. In this case, I was planning to start a blog for some time now, and the realizing event was updating my website. I used <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">this</a> beautiful template, which comes with great resources to host a blog.</p>

<p>So, here it is! I plan to write—as the <a href="/blog/">blog’s name</a> suggests—on logic, broadly construed. I will cover topics from <a href="/publications/">my research</a> at the intersection of math, philosophy, and AI, or simply ideas that I want to learn more about. Let’s see where this will take us.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first post on this blog]]></summary></entry></feed>
