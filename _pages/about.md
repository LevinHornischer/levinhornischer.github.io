Welcome to my website! I'm an assistant professor at the <a href='https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html'>Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy (MCMP)</a> at <a href='https://www.lmu.de/en/'>LMU Munich</a>.

My [research](/publications/) and [teaching](/teaching/) is mostly on the mathematical and philosophical foundations of artificial intelligence.

I'm also interested in related disciplines such as theoretical computer science, dynamical systems theory, mathematical logic, philosophical logic, philosophy of language, and epistemology.

Before coming to Munich, I was a postdoc at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/home). There, I also obtained my PhD with a dissertation on [Dynamical Systems via Domains](https://eprints.illc.uva.nl/id/eprint/2196/1/DS-2021-10.text.pdf), supervised by [Michiel van Lambalgen](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/l/a/m.vanlambalgen/m.vanlambalgen.html) (Amsterdam) and [Franz Berto](https://research-portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/en/persons/franz-berto) (St Andrews). The project was funded by my NWO grant on [Foundations of Analogical Thinking](https://www.nwo.nl/en/projects/322-20-017).
