Hey there, and welcome to this blog! In this very first post, I figured I'd say a quick word about the *what & why* of this blog, before writing the first post with actual content next.

This blog, like many things, got started after having had a loose plan for a while, until some event provided the momentum to realize the plan. In this case, I was planning to start a blog for some time now, and the realizing event was updating my website. I used [this](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) beautiful template, which comes with great resources to host a blog.

So, here it is! I plan to write—as the [blog's name](/blog/) suggests—on logic, broadly construed. I will cover topics from [my research](/publications/) at the intersection of math, philosophy, and AI, or simply ideas that I want to learn more about. Let's see where this will take us.
